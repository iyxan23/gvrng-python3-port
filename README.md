## Modern GvRng Port

This repo is an attempt to port [GvRng](https://gvr.sourceforge.net/download)
version 4.4, a free and open-source simplistic programming language
developed by [Jeffery Elkner](http://www.elkner.net/) designed to introduce
beginners to the fundamentals of programming.

GvRng is short for "GvR Next Generation", GvR being "Guido van Robot".

### Motivation

This silly porting project started because I was struggling to run GvRng as
instructed in my university's curriculum. Realizing it has not been updated for
15 years (last update was 2010, according to its
[official site](<(https://gvr.sourceforge.net)>)) yet still uses python2 and the
old deprecated pygtk library, I decided to port this both for fun and I guess
as python refresher.

### License

GvRng is originally licensed with GPLv2 as seen in the [copyright file](./copyright)

### Notes

1.  This port is super dirty right now, I am prioritizing getting it running
    first before any cleanups.
2.  I omitted the `docs/` folder from this repository
